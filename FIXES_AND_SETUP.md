# IMS Frontend - Fixes and Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Gateway Routing Issues
**Problem**: Services were not working with port 1016 because of incorrect URL patterns.

**Root Cause**: 
- API Gateway routes are configured with `/api/` prefix (e.g., `/api/product/**`, `/api/supplier/**`)
- Frontend services were using inconsistent URL patterns

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated Product Service: `/product` → `/api/product`
- ✅ Updated Order Service: `/order` → `/api/order`  
- ✅ Updated Analytics Service: `http://localhost:8085/api/report` → `/api/report`
- ✅ Updated proxy configuration to include all API routes
- ✅ Supplier and Stock services were already correct

### 2. Dashboard Analytics Issues
**Problem**: Dashboard was trying to connect directly to port 8085 instead of using API Gateway.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated Analytics Service to use API Gateway (`/api/report`)
- ✅ Updated error messages to reference correct port (1016)
- ✅ Dashboard now works through API Gateway routing

### 3. Logout Functionality
**Problem**: User requested logout functionality to be added.

**Status**: ✅ **Already Implemented**
- Logout buttons exist in both Admin and User navigation components
- Logout functionality clears authentication token and redirects to login
- Enhanced role-nav component with better user feedback

## Updated Service URLs

| Service | Old URL | New URL | Status |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Product | `/product` | `/api/product` | ✅ Fixed |
| Order | `/order` | `/api/order` | ✅ Fixed |
| Supplier | `/api/supplier` | `/api/supplier` | ✅ Already Correct |
| Stock | `/api/stock` | `/api/stock` | ✅ Already Correct |
| Analytics | `http://localhost:8085/api/report` | `/api/report` | ✅ Fixed |
| Auth | `/auth` | `/auth` | ✅ Already Correct |

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following services are running:

1. **API Gateway** on port `1016`
2. **Product Management Service** (registered with Eureka)
3. **Order Management Service** (registered with Eureka)
4. **Stock Management Service** (registered with Eureka)
5. **Supplier Management Service** (registered with Eureka)
6. **Reporting and Analytics Service** (registered with Eureka)
7. **Eureka Server** on port `8761`

### Starting the Frontend

#### Option 1: Using the Startup Script
```bash
# Run the provided batch file
start-app.bat
```

#### Option 2: Manual Start
```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start with proxy configuration
ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json
```

#### Option 3: Alternative Manual Start
```bash
# Start on specific host and port
ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4200
```

### Accessing the Application
- **Frontend URL**: http://localhost:4200
- **API Gateway URL**: http://localhost:1016

## Proxy Configuration

The `proxy.conf.json` now correctly routes all API calls:

```json
{
  "/api/order/*": { "target": "http://localhost:1016" },
  "/api/product/*": { "target": "http://localhost:1016" },
  "/auth/*": { "target": "http://localhost:1016" },
  "/api/stock/*": { "target": "http://localhost:1016" },
  "/api/supplier/*": { "target": "http://localhost:1016" },
  "/api/report/*": { "target": "http://localhost:1016" }
}
```

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Product Service
- Navigate to Products page
- Try adding, updating, or deleting products
- Should now work through API Gateway (port 1016)

### 2. Test Order Service  
- Navigate to Orders page
- Try creating or viewing orders
- Should now work through API Gateway (port 1016)

### 3. Test Dashboard Analytics
- Navigate to Dashboard
- Try loading reports with date ranges
- Should now work through API Gateway instead of direct port 8085

### 4. Test Supplier Service
- Navigate to Suppliers page
- Should continue working (was already correct)

### 5. Test Logout Functionality
- Click on user/admin dropdown in navigation
- Click "Logout" button
- Should clear session and redirect to login

## Troubleshooting

### If services still don't work:

1. **Check API Gateway Status**
   ```bash
   # Verify API Gateway is running on port 1016
   curl http://localhost:1016/actuator/health
   ```

2. **Check Eureka Registration**
   - Visit http://localhost:8761
   - Verify all microservices are registered

3. **Check Browser Network Tab**
   - Open Developer Tools → Network
   - Look for 404 or 500 errors
   - Verify requests are going to localhost:4200 (which proxies to 1016)

4. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for CORS errors
   - Look for authentication token issues
   - Look for network connectivity issues

### Common Issues:

- **CORS Errors**: Ensure API Gateway has proper CORS configuration
- **Authentication Issues**: Check if JWT tokens are being sent correctly
- **Network Errors**: Verify all backend services are running and registered

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files:
- `src/app/services/product-service.ts` - Updated API URL
- `src/app/services/order.service.ts` - Updated API URL  
- `src/app/services/analytics.service.ts` - Updated API URL and error messages
- `src/app/navigation/role-nav.ts` - Enhanced with better user feedback
- `proxy.conf.json` - Added missing routes and fixed existing ones

### New Files:
- `start-app.bat` - Startup script for easy application launch

## Next Steps

1. Start all backend services
2. Run the frontend using one of the methods above
3. Test all functionality to ensure everything works correctly
4. Monitor console logs for any remaining issues

The application should now work correctly with all services routing through the API Gateway on port 1016!
